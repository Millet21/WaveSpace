1. Write Unit test for force dimord function cases:
    - freq_trl_posx_posy_time > trl_chan_time
    - Even more leading dimensions (before posx or chan)
    
1. Fix animation function to be speedier (plotting.animate_grid_data)
2. Fullfield snr ramping onsets and offsets for radial and target waves
3. Rename rotating waves to spiral waves
4. Would be nice if rotating/spiral waves would have a center that can be set
7. Make Nice comments on the entire example
