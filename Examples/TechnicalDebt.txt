1. Write Unit test for force dimord function cases:
    - freq_trl_posx_posy_time > trl_chan_time
    - Even more leading dimensions (before posx or chan)
    
1. Fix animation function to be speedier (plotting.animate_grid_data)
2. Fullfield snr ramping onsets and offsets for radial and target waves
3. Rename rotating waves to spiral waves
4. Would be nice if rotating/spiral waves would have a center that can be set
7. Make Nice comments on the entire example
81. Go through plotting functions, delete and include as necessary
b. do a race between optical flow functions. (IF the results are the same but one is faster, the other one goes)
x. Make genphase nice colored figure as seen in  https://camo.githubusercontent.com/48a0f590335430e4053f18045247b33d6db70cd54c9ea25534cdf8ca4da14877/68747470733a2f2f6d756c6c65726c61622e63612f6173736574732f696d672f67702d64656d6f2f67705f64656d6f2e706e67

Kirsten parisweek tasks:
1. Make the grid to visualise which sourcepoints have been selected for distancecorrelation
2. Also run it once over the entire grid to create pictures for presentation
