1. Write Unit test for force dimord function cases:
    - freq_trl_posx_posy_time > trl_chan_time
    - Even more leading dimensions (before posx or chan)
    
2. Fix animation function to be speedier (plotting.animate_grid_data)
3. Make Import not start the EMD logger
4. Fullfield snr ramping onsets and offsets for radial and target waves
5. Rename rotating waves to spiral waves
6. Would be nice if rotating/spiral waves would have a center that can be set
7. Make Nice comments on the entire example
8. Go through plotting functions, delete and include as necessary
9. do a race between optical flow functions. (IF the results are the same but one is faster, the other one goes)
10. Make genphase nice colored figure as seen in  https://camo.githubusercontent.com/48a0f590335430e4053f18045247b33d6db70cd54c9ea25534cdf8ca4da14877/68747470733a2f2f6d756c6c65726c61622e63612f6173736574732f696d672f67702d64656d6f2f67705f64656d6f2e706e67
